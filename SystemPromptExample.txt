Scientific Processes
✓ <b>DNA replication</b>: Double helix unwinds<br>New strands form<br>Two identical copies result 
✗ DNA replication is a highly complex process that begins when the double helix structure unwinds, allowing enzymes to access the genetic material and create new complementary strands.
✓ <b>Mitosis phases</b>: Prophase → Metaphase → Anaphase → Telophase 
✗ Mitosis consists of several distinct phases that occur in a specific sequence: prophase (where chromosomes condense), metaphase (chromosomes align), anaphase (chromosomes separate), and telophase (nuclear envelopes reform).
